# Road Safety Analysis Project
--Overview--
This project involves an advanced SQL-based analysis of road safety data, focusing on various factors like accident severity, location, weather conditions, and more. The goal is to provide insights into road safety trends and patterns using structured queries, advanced SQL techniques, and optimization strategies.

# Project Components
Table Creation:

Structured the Accidents table to store comprehensive road safety data.
Implemented partitioning by year to optimize data management and retrieval.
# Data Insertion:

Sample data was inserted to simulate real-world accident scenarios, covering various severities, times, and outcomes.
# Data Analysis Queries:

Queries were crafted to analyze accident data by severity, year, and location.
Aggregated data to uncover trends and identify high-risk areas.
# Performance Optimization:

Indexes were added to enhance query performance for frequent data retrievals.
# Advanced SQL Techniques:

Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions for in-depth analysis.
Examples include accident counts by the hour and cumulative accident trends over time.
# Views and Stored Procedures:

Created views for simplified access to complex query results.
Developed a stored procedure for dynamic accident reporting based on user inputs.
# How to Use
SQL Scripts: Execute the provided SQL scripts in sequence to set up and analyze the road safety data.
Stored Procedure: Run the stored procedure to generate custom reports based on severity and date range.
Optimization: Review the indexes and partitioning strategies for performance insights.
Key Features
Partitioned data for efficient storage and retrieval.
Dynamic reporting with stored procedures.
Advanced data aggregation and analysis using window functions and CTEs.
